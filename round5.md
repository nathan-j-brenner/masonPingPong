## feedback from round 4

So I did a really bad job on round 4.  I should have been more specific about where to look for the _pull request_.  __GitHub__ is where teams of devs share code.  Right now, it's awesome because I can work on something at home on my super awesome mac, send it to gitHub, then I'm able to clone it at work and see the code.  In fact, last night I was refactoring that form project I made over the weekend until about 1:30.  Everything was working well, can't wait to get to the refactoring I'm at with the templated email request.

Also the javascript code was wrong, but ironically it proved to be a great place to work from for the next challenge.  From local master, I made a pull request from the remote master (gitHub). I ran `node feelings.js`, but I didn't get what I expected, so I created a new branch called `debugging`, and played with the code from there.  I got it working at one point, but then made some change that I can't remember and realized it was broken.  This happens realy all the time, it just happened on the templated email request form.

Version control is great because you can switch back to previous versions.  `git reset` is the command for this, and every time I run into a situation where I have to use it, I have to rewatch a youtube video because there are three types of `git resets`: soft, mixed, and hard.  Most of the time it's the hard reset that I want to use, but I'm nervous about using it, so I rewatch the videos.  That's what you're going to need to do now: Watch the videos, or learn about git reset somewhere else, look at the log, and figure out what you have to do to fix the code.  You could probably get away with not understanding the javascript, but I would encourage you to do so.  If you don't recognize something, google it.  When you've figured out the solution, think of a way to add some functionallity to the program.  Maybe there's something you've learned about javascript recently that you could apply to this program.  When it's fixed and you've added something new, commit everything, push up to the remote, and make a pull request in gitHub from the remote `debugging` branch to the remote `master` branch.
